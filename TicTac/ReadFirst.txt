X and 0           Version 1.0.1

This is my first program(revisited) written in VB, which actually does something, so excuse my 
programming style . It is just a programming exercise.


If you want some explanation of this tangled code here there are a few.

	-The game are played on a grid of buttons which are indexed from 0 to 8
	-In order to make the calculation easier I declared an array,mat(1 To 3, 1 To 3) to
	  store the indexes of the buttons.
	-Since there are only eight possibilities to win the game I declare another array,
	 mat2(1 To 8,1 To 3) to store the indexes of the buttons in all the eight combinations.
	-mat3(1 To 8,1 To 3) stores the captions of the buttons at a given stage of the game.
	-After that, the program count, for each row of  mat3, the X-es, the 0-es and the blanks,
	and if you don't understand the rest but want to, please let me know.





	   mat(1 To 3, 1 To 3)      mat2(1 To 8, 1 To 3)
 
	           |0|1|2|	                  |0|1|2|
	           |	3|4|5|                      |3|4|5|
	           |6|7|8|                      |6|7|8|
				     |0|3|6|
				     |1|4|7|
				     |2|5|8|
				     |0|4|8|
				     |2|4|6|


 Besides you I don't need to thank to anybody because I made the program without help or advices so:
